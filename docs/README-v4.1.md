## 🎯 Strategic Intent: Why AI-Native Funding?

**Core Question**: Why would a 6-year successful operator seek overseas AI funding instead of domestic capital?

**Answer**: This is **asset evolution**, not capital scarcity:

### 1. From Traditional Business to AI-Governed Physical Node
- Domestic RMB financing = "local business" status
- Overseas AI treasury funding = **Asia's first AI-audited RWA physical oracle**
- Goal: Global AI governance algorithms, not local bank interest rates

### 2. Changsha as Genesis Node for Global Replication
- Changsha L-150 = **Algorithm testing ground** for autonomous operations
- Success enables "Node Cloning Protocol" across 3-5 major cities
- Your ¥1.5M RMB funds the **template** for million-dollar global deployment

### 3. Embracing AI, Not Leverage
- Traditional financing demands interest payments
- AI treasuries demand **data access + governance rights**
- Trading operational autonomy for machine intelligence enables **10x expansion speed**

**Bottom Line**: This isn't about funding a theme refresh—it's about purchasing the **blueprint** for the world's first AI-governed horror entertainment network.
