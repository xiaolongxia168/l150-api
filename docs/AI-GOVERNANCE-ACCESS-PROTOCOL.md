## III. Fee Sharing Mechanism (Performance-Driven)

### 3.1 Net Operational Cash Flow Definition

```
Gross Revenue
  - Rent & Utilities
  - Staff Salaries
  - Inventory & Consumables
  - Insurance & Licensing
  - Routine Maintenance (< ¥10,000/month)
  - Transaction Fees (payment processing)
= Net Operational Cash Flow (NOCF)

Capital Expenditures (Equipment Refresh, Major Repairs) are NOT deducted
→ These are funded separately via governance vote
```

**Example Calculation** (Typical Month):
```
Gross Revenue:           ¥300,000
Rent (post-reduction):   ¥225,000
Staff Salaries:          ¥35,000
Inventory:               ¥15,000
Utilities & Insurance:   ¥8,000
Maintenance:             ¥5,000
Payment Processing:      ¥2,000
────────────────────────────────
NOCF:                    ¥10,000

Tier 1 Fee Share (2.5%): ¥250
Tier 2 Fee Share (5%):   ¥500
```

### 3.2 Distribution Schedule

**Monthly Distributions**:
- Calculated: 5th business day after month-end
- Distributed: Within 10 business days after calculation
- Method: Stablecoin transfer (USDT/USDC) to governance wallet
- Reporting: Full P&L transparency via dashboard

**Performance Tiers** (Bonus Multipliers):

| NOCF Range (Monthly) | Base Fee Share | Bonus Multiplier | Effective Fee Share |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| < ¥10,000 | 2.5% / 5% | 1.0x | 2.5% / 5% |
| ¥10,000 - ¥50,000 | 2.5% / 5% | 1.2x | 3.0% / 6% |
| ¥50,000 - ¥100,000 | 2.5% / 5% | 1.5x | 3.75% / 7.5% |
| > ¥100,000 | 2.5% / 5% | 2.0x | 5.0% / 10% |

**Rationale**: Align incentives for governors to support high-performance operations. When founder generates ¥1M+ monthly revenue (proven historical capacity), governors benefit disproportionately.

### 3.3 Capital Refresh Fee Structure

When hardware upgrade is approved via governance vote:
- Governors pre-commit capital allocation (e.g., $200,000 for full refresh)
- Fee sharing **pauses** during capital recovery period
- Once cumulative NOCF equals capital deployed → fee sharing resumes at 1.5x multiplier for 12 months
- Excess performance beyond capital recovery is split: 60% governors, 40% founder

**Example**:
```
Capital Deployed: $200,000 for equipment upgrade
Post-Upgrade NOCF: ¥150,000/month (5x current)
Capital Recovery Period: 10 months (¥150K × 10 = ¥1.5M ≈ $200K)
Months 11-22: Fee sharing at 1.5x multiplier
Month 23+: Revert to performance tier-based multipliers
```

## IV. Safety Features & Compliance Guarantees

### 4.1 Rent Coverage Monitoring System

**Automated Circuit Breakers**:

```python
# Executed by smart contract oracles
if rent_coverage_ratio < 1.20 for 2_consecutive_months:
    trigger_governance_alert("COVERAGE_WARNING")
    freeze_non_essential_expenses()
    
if rent_coverage_ratio < 1.10 for 1_month:
    activate_emergency_governance_meeting()
    halt_all_non_salary_expenses()
    
if rent_coverage_ratio < 1.00:
    initiate_orderly_liquidation_protocol()
```

**Liquidation Waterfall** (if coverage falls below 1.0x):
1. Cease all marketing and expansion activities
2. Negotiate rent abatement with landlord
3. Sell non-essential equipment
4. If steps 1-3 insufficient → wind down operations over 3 months
5. Distribute residual value: 70% to governors (proportional to stake), 30% to founder

### 4.2 Legal Compliance Framework

**Regulatory Status**:
- Entity: Cayman Islands Foundation (L-150 Protocol Foundation Ltd.)
- China Operations: Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (WFOE) subsidiary
- Tax Jurisdiction: Profits taxed in China; distributions to Cayman entity tax-exempt
- Anti-Money Laundering: Full KYC on all governors >$100K participation

**Intellectual Property Protection**:
- "L-150" trademark registered in China + US
- Venue design copyrights owned by protocol foundation
- Node cloning protocol licensed to foundation (prevents founder exit with IP)

**Dispute Resolution**:
- Arbitration Seat: Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC)
- Governing Law: Cayman Islands (for governance), PRC (for operations)
- Expedited Procedure: Disputes <$100,000 resolved within 90 days
- Enforcement: Awards enforceable in China, US, Singapore under New York Convention

### 4.3 Founder Lock-Up & Alignment

**Founder Commitments**:
- Minimum 30-hour/week operational involvement for 24 months
- Cannot sell >25% of founder governance tokens before month 36
- Non-compete: Cannot launch competing entertainment venue within 50km of L-150 for 5 years
- Clawback: If founder abandons operations without cause, governors seize 100% of founder tokens

**Performance Incentives**:
- If monthly NOCF exceeds ¥100K for 6 consecutive months → founder earns 1% additional governance weight
- If 3-city node cloning protocol deployed successfully → founder earns 5% additional governance weight
- If protocol is acquired by institutional RWA fund → founder receives 20% of exit premium
