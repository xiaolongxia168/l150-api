Data Access Rights Technical Specification ### 2.1 Real-Time Data Streams **POS Integration** (Tier 1 + Tier 2): ```json { "stream_id": "L150-POS-MAINNET", "update_frequency": "per_transaction", "data_fields": [ "transaction_timestamp", "gross_revenue_cny", "payment_method", "discount_applied", "session_type", "customer_count" ], "merkle_anchor": "Ethereum_Mainnet", "verification_delay": "< 60 seconds" } ``` **Occupancy Metrics** (Tier 1 + Tier 2): ```json { "stream_id": "L150-BOOKING-SYSTEM", "update_frequency": "hourly", "data_fields": [ "current_bookings", "48h_forecast", "capacity_utilization", "cancellation_rate", "repeat_customer_ratio", "peak_demand_windows" ], "api_endpoint": "https://l150-oracle.protocol/v1/occupancy" } ``` **Operational Logs** (Tier 2 Only): ```json { "stream_id": "L150-OPERATIONS-ARCHIVE", "update_frequency": "daily", "data_fields": [ "staff_scheduling", "inventory_movements", "maintenance_logs", "customer_complaints", "equipment_downtime", "competitor_intelligence" ], "retention_period": "72_months", "export_format": "JSON, CSV, Parquet" } ``` ### 2.2 Predictive Analytics API (Tier 2 Exclusive) **Machine Learning Models Provided**: 1. **Revenue Forecasting Model** - Input: Historical 90-day data + holiday calendar - Output: 30-day revenue projection with confidence intervals - Accuracy: 87% within ±10% band (backtested) 2. **Rent Coverage Risk Score** - Input: Current revenue trends + expense trajectory - Output: Probability of falling below 1.2x coverage in next 3 months - Alert Threshold: >20% probability triggers governance notification 3. **Customer Churn Prediction** - Input: Booking patterns + review sentiment - Output: 60-day churn risk by customer segment - Use Case: Proactive retention campaign triggers ### 2.3 Physical Verification Protocol **Quarterly Livestream Audits**: ``` Format: 2-hour unedited livestream Mandatory Elements: ✓ 360° venue walkthrough ✓ POS terminal screen share (showing daily totals) ✓ Customer interaction samples (privacy-compliant) ✓ Equipment condition assessment ✓ Staff interview (anonymous if requested) ✓ Landlord relationship status check Recording: Archived on IPFS, hash anchored on-chain Attendance: Minimum 1 Tier 2 governor or designated auditor Failure to Conduct: Constitutes material breach → governance intervention ``` **Optional On-Site Inspections**: - Tier 2 governors may request physical visit with 30-day notice - Protocol covers reasonable travel expenses (capped at $2,000/visit) - Maximum 2 visits per year per governor - Management must provide full operational access during visit --- ## III. Fee Sharing Mechanism (Performance-Driven) ### 3.1 Net Operational Cash Flow Definition ``` Gross Revenue - Rent & Utilities - Staff Salaries - Inventory & Consumables - Insurance & Licensing - Routine Maintenance (< ¥10,000/month) - Transaction Fees (payment processing) = Net Operational Cash Flow (NOCF) Capital Expenditures (Equipment Refresh, Major Repairs) are NOT deducted → These are funded separately via governance vote ``` **Example Calculation** (Typical Month - 基于修正后数据): ``` Gross Revenue: ¥200,000 [修正: 原300,000] Rent (post-reduction): ¥90,000 [修正: 原225,000] Staff Salaries: ¥35,000 Inventory: ¥15,000 Utilities & Insurance: ¥8,000 Maintenance: ¥5,000 Payment Processing: ¥2,000 ──────────────────────────────── NOCF: ¥45,000 [修正: 原10,000] Tier 1 Fee Share (2.5%): ¥1,125 [修正: 原250] Tier 2 Fee Share (5%): ¥2,250 [修正: 原500] ``` ### 3.2 Distribution Schedule **Monthly Distributions**: - Calculated: 5th business day after month-end - Distributed: Within 10 business days after calculation - Method: Stablecoin transfer (USDT/USDC) to governance wallet - Reporting: Full P&L transparency via dashboard **Performance Tiers** (Bonus Multipliers): | NOCF Range (Monthly) | Base Fee Share | Bonus Multiplier | Effective Fee Share | |----------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------| | < ¥10,000 | 2.5% / 5% | 1.0x | 2.5% / 5% | | ¥10,000 - ¥50,000 | 2.5% / 5% | 1.2x | 3.0% / 6% | | ¥50,000 - ¥100,000 | 2.5% / 5% | 1.5x | 3.75% / 7.5% | | > ¥100,000 | 2.5% / 5% | 2.0x | 5.0% / 10% | **Rationale**: Align incentives for governors to support high-performance operations. When founder generates ¥1M+ monthly revenue (proven historical capacity), governors benefit disproportionately. ### 3.3 Capital Refresh Fee Structure When hardware upgrade is approved via governance vote: - Governors pre-commit capital allocation (e.g., $200,000 for full refresh) - Fee sharing **pauses** during capital recovery period - Once cumulative NOCF equals capital deployed → fee sharing resumes at 1.5x multiplier for 12 months - Excess performance beyond capital recovery is split: 60% governors, 40% founder **Example**: ``` Capital Deployed: $200,000 for equipment upgrade Post-Upgrade NOCF: ¥150,000/month (硬件刷新后预期) Capital Recovery Period: 13.3 months (¥150K × 13.3 = ¥2M ≈ $200K) Months 14-25: Fee sharing at 1.5x multiplier Month 26+: Revert to performance tier-based multipliers ``` --- ## IV. Safety Features & Compliance Guarantees ### 4.1 Rent Coverage Monitoring System **Automated Circuit Breakers**: ```python # Executed by smart contract oracles if rent_coverage_ratio < 1.20 for 2_consecutive_months: trigger_governance_alert("COVERAGE_WARNING") freeze_non_essential_expenses() if rent_coverage_ratio < 1.10 for 1_month: activate_emergency_governance_meeting() halt_all_non_salary_expenses() if rent_coverage_ratio < 1.00: initiate_orderly_liquidation_protocol() ``` **Liquidation Waterfall** (if coverage falls below 1.0x): 1. Cease all marketing and expansion activities 2. Negotiate rent abatement with landlord 3. Sell non-essential equipment 4. If steps 1-3 insufficient → wind down operations over 3 months 5. Distribute residual value: 70% to governors (proportional to stake), 30% to founder ### 4.2 Legal Compliance Framework **Regulatory Status**: - Entity: Cayman Islands Foundation (L-150 Protocol Foundation Ltd.) - China Operations: Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (WFOE) subsidiary - Tax Jurisdiction: Profits taxed in China; distributions to Cayman entity tax-exempt - Anti-Money Laundering: Full KYC on all governors >$100K participation **Intellectual Property Protection**: - "L-150" trademark registered in China + US - Venue design copyrights owned by protocol foundation - Node cloning protocol licensed to foundation (prevents founder exit with IP) **Dispute Resolution**: - Arbitration Seat: Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) - Governing Law: Cayman Islands (for governance), PRC (for operations) - Expedited Procedure: Disputes <$100,000 resolved within 90 days - Enforcement: Awards enforceable in China, US, Singapore under New York Convention ### 4.3 Founder Lock-Up & Alignment **Founder Commitments**: - Minimum 30-hour/week operational involvement for 24 months - Cannot sell >25% of founder governance tokens before month 36 - Non-compete: Cannot launch competing entertainment venue within 50km of L-150 for 5 years - Clawback: If founder abandons operations without cause, governors seize 100% of founder tokens **Performance Incentives**: - If monthly NOCF exceeds ¥100K for 6 consecutive months → founder earns 1% additional governance weight - If 3-city node cloning protocol deployed successfully → founder earns 5% additional governance weight - If protocol is acquired by institutional RWA fund → founder receives 20% of exit premium --- ## V.
