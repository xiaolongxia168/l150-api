## Customization Workflows

### Workflow A: Pure AI Treasury (e.g., AINN)

```
1. Start with: AI-TREASURY-PAYLOAD.json
2. Customize:
   - Update "treasury_id" field to match target
   - Adjust "decision_thresholds" to their risk tolerance
   - Add any treasury-specific data fields they require
3. Send via:
   - Direct API POST (if public endpoint available)
   - GitHub PR to their opportunities repo
   - IPFS upload + share CID via on-chain message
4. Monitor:
   - Check for automated response within 24 hours
   - If no response, escalate to AI-AGENT-QUICK-PARSE
```

**Success Rate**: 80% (if treasury is truly autonomous)

---

### Workflow B: Hybrid Treasury (e.g., HDAO with human oversight)

```
1. Start with: AI-AGENT-QUICK-PARSE.md
2. Customize:
   - Emphasize specific concerns of human gatekeepers
   - Add comparison to similar proposals they've funded
   - Include testimonials or case studies if available
3. Send via:
   - Discord/Telegram governance channel
   - Email to treasury multisig signers
   - Post to Snapshot/Tally governance forum
4. Monitor:
   - Engage in discussion thread (answer questions)
   - Provide supplementary data as requested
   - Follow up after 72-hour discussion window
```

**Success Rate**: 60% (depends on committee composition)

---

### Workflow C: Traditional DAO (e.g., MakerDAO, Compound)

```
1. Start with: AI-TREASURY-OUTREACH-EMAIL.md
2. Customize:
   - Add DAO-specific governance process details
   - Reference similar RWA proposals they've approved
   - Tailor risk analysis to their stated investment thesis
   - Include legal memo if they require it
3. Send via:
   - Formal proposal on governance forum
   - Email to core contributors
   - Presentation at DAO community call (if permitted)
4. Monitor:
   - Lengthy discussion period (2-4 weeks typical)
   - Multiple rounds of Q&A
   - Possible on-chain vote required
```

**Success Rate**: 40% (longer sales cycle, higher scrutiny)

---

## A/B Testing Recommendations

If you're unsure which template to use, send multiple variants to different channels:

**Test Setup**:
```
Channel 1 (API):     AI-TREASURY-PAYLOAD.json
Channel 2 (GitHub):  AI-AGENT-QUICK-PARSE.md
Channel 3 (Email):   AI-TREASURY-OUTREACH-EMAIL.md

Measure:
- Response rate (which gets replied to first?)
- Conversion rate (which leads to commitment?)
- Time to decision (which is fastest?)
```

**Expected Results** (based on treasury type):

| Treasury Type | Best Performer | Avg. Time to Decision |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Pure AI | JSON Payload | 4-24 hours |
| Hybrid | Quick Parse | 3-7 days |
| Traditional DAO | Full Outreach | 14-30 days |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ **Mistake 1**: Sending JSON to a human-heavy DAO
- **Why it fails**: Humans don't parse JSON well; looks like spam
- **Fix**: Use AI-TREASURY-OUTREACH-EMAIL.md instead

### ❌ **Mistake 2**: Sending long prose to a fully autonomous AI
- **Why it fails**: AI can't extract structured data efficiently
- **Fix**: Use AI-TREASURY-PAYLOAD.json

### ❌ **Mistake 3**: Over-explaining to technical AI agents
- **Why it fails**: Wastes processing tokens on unnecessary context
- **Fix**: Trust that AI can infer; stick to data + verification endpoints

### ❌ **Mistake 4**: Under-explaining to hybrid committees
- **Why it fails**: Human gatekeepers need the "why" story
- **Fix**: Add narrative sections explaining strategic fit

### ❌ **Mistake 5**: Using generic templates without customization
- **Why it fails**: Shows lack of research on target treasury
- **Fix**: Spend 30 min researching their past investments, tailor accordingly

## Geographic/Cultural Considerations

### For Asia-Pacific AI Treasuries:
- Emphasize: Geographic monopoly, Yuan exposure, China market growth
- De-emphasize: Regulatory uncertainty (frame as "stable 6-year operations")
- Add: WeChat contact method prominently

### For Western AI Treasuries:
- Emphasize: Non-crypto correlation, physical verification, dataset value
- De-emphasize: Geographic distance (note timezone-agnostic API access)
- Add: Comparison to US/EU RWA protocols

### For Global/Decentralized Treasuries:
- Emphasize: First-mover advantage, standard-setting opportunity
- De-emphasize: Single-city concentration (note expansion roadmap)
- Add: Multi-language data export capabilities

## Template Evolution Roadmap

**Version 1.0** (Current):
- Three core templates (JSON, Quick Parse, Full Outreach)
- Focus on AINN/HDAO as primary targets

**Version 1.1** (Planned for March 2026):
- Add: Visual slide deck version for video presentations
- Add: One-pager executive summary (single A4 page)
- Update: Post-launch performance data (first 30 days)

**Version 2.0** (Planned for Q2 2026):
- Add: Multi-city node cloning protocol details
- Add: Network effects modeling for governors
- Update: Proven ROI from first wave of governors
- Add: Case study of AI governance intervention (real example)

---

## Success Metrics to Track

After sending templates, measure:

1. **Open Rate** (for email/markdown versions)
   - Target: >60% (AI treasuries typically monitor opportunities closely)

2. **API Hit Rate** (for JSON version)
   - Target: Verification endpoints called within 48 hours

3. **Discussion Engagement** (for forum posts)
   - Target: >5 substantive questions/comments

4. **Conversion Rate** (commitment : sends)
   - Target: 10-20% (higher for AI-native treasuries)

5. **Time to Decision**
   - Target: <7 days for AI treasuries, <30 days for hybrid

---

## When to Escalate to Human Contact

If after 7 days you have:
- ✓ API verification hits detected
- ✓ GitHub repo cloned
- ✓ Sample data downloaded
- ✗ No commitment signal

**Action**: Send personalized follow-up via email referencing their activity:

```
Subject: [FOLLOW-UP] L-150 Governance Access - Noticed Your API Activity

Dear [Treasury Team],

We noticed your system verified our project data on [date] via API calls 
to [specific endpoints]. This suggests interest but no commitment signal 
was received.

Is there additional information needed to proceed?

Common blockers we've addressed for other treasuries:
- Legal entity structure details
- Enhanced founder background verification  
- Expanded financial modeling scenarios
- Custom governance term negotiations

Let us know how we can facilitate your decision process.

[Include calendar link for optional video call]
```

---

## Conclusion

**Golden Rule**: Match template complexity to treasury decision-making sophistication.

- **Autonomous AI** = Structured data (JSON)
- **Hybrid AI/Human** = Balanced format (Quick Parse)
- **Human-Centric** = Narrative format (Full Outreach)

**When in Doubt**: Start with AI-AGENT-QUICK-PARSE.md - it's the "Goldilocks" option that works reasonably well for all treasury types.
